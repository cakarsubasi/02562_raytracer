# Worksheet 4: Bonus exercises

# Part 8

> The Earth and Mars receive energy from the Sun. Is the radiance from the Sun identical on the two planets?
Explain your answer. Why is it warmest on the Earth? Reconsider your answers after the next calculations.
Assume the Sun is a diffuse emitter of total power 3.91 · 1026 W and the surface area is 6.07 · 1018 m2
.
Calculate the radiance from the Sun on the two planets. Assume the Sun is in zenith and the distance from
the Sun to the Earth and Mars is 1.5 · 1011 m and 2.28 · 1011 m, respectively.
Find the solid angle the Sun is observed under at the Earth and Mars.
How much energy is received on a 1 × 1 m2
surface on the Earth and Mars, respectively?

# Part 9

> A horizontal plate is illuminated on a cloudy day. The sky has a uniform radiance of 1000 W/(m2
sr).
Calculate the irradiance at the center of the plate.
Find the result if the sky is blocked so only a conical section (half angle 30◦
) of the sky can be seen from the
center of the plate.
