# The Basics


As I have chosen to do this project in Rust instead of
Javascript, this section will differ the strongest from
the prescribed exercises. 

In addition, Rust requires a much more significant amount
of "boilerplate" code to manage windows, UI, and hardware
access as we do not have a browser and a DOM to take care
of difficult parts for us. This would also make it 
considerably more difficult to provide a full copy of the code (as it would get out of control very quickly) for each
section, 

# 1. Drawing to a Window, Clearing the Background

Done, need images, need tag

Most of the window management code is based directly on {{#cite LEARNWGPU:1}}.

Winit also supports the browser and here is a screenshot 


# 2. Drawing a Rectangle

Done, need images, need tag

# 3. UV Coordinates as pixel color

Done, need images, need tag

# 4. Default scene

Done, need images, need tag

Also need to fix up the color

# 5. Uniform variables, Zoom and Aspect Ratio

Not done, zoom is done by moving the camera right now

Need images, need tag

# 6. Basic shading

Done, need images, need tag
