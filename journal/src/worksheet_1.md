As I have chosen to do this project in Rust instead of
Javascript, this section will differ the strongest from
the prescribed exercises. 

In addition, Rust requires a much more significant amount
of "boilerplate" code to manage windows, UI, and hardware
access as we do not have a browser and a DOM to take care
of difficult parts for us. This would also make it 
considerably more difficult to provide a full copy of the code (as it would get out of control very quickly) for each
section,
