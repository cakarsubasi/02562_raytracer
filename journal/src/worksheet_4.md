# Worksheet 4: Radiometric and Photometric exercises

# Part 1

> A small 25 W light bulb has an efficiency of 20%. How many photons are approximately emitted per second? Assume in the calculations that we only use average photons of wavelength 500 nm.

The energy of a single photon can be calculated with:

\\[E_{photon} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\\]

Where \\(h\\) is the Planck constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \\(\lambda\\) is the wavelength. \\(hc\\) has a constant value of around \\(2\times10^{-25}Jm\\)

So in this case:

\\[E_{photon}\approx 4\times10^{-19}J\\]

The number of photons can be found with:

\\[n=\frac{P\eta}{E_{photon}}\\] 

per unit time where \\(\eta\\) is the efficiency.

Therefore the number of photons is approximately \\(1.25\times10^{19}\frac{1}{s}\\).

# Part 2

>A light bulb (2.4 V and 0.7 A), which is approximately sphere-shaped with a diameter of 1 cm, emits light equally in all directions. Find the following entities (ideal conditions assumed)
>
> - Radiant flux
> - Radiant intensity
> - Radiant exitance
> - Emitted energy in 5 minutes
>
>Use \\(W\\) for Watt, \\(J\\) for Joule, \\(m\\) for meter, \\(s\\) for second and \\(sr\\) for steradian

- Energy: \\(Q = P \times t\\)

- Radiant Flux (Power): \\(\Phi = \frac{dE}{dt} = IV\\)

\\(2.4V \times 0.7A = 1.68 W = 1.68 J s^-1\\)


- Radiant Intensity: \\(I = \frac{d\Phi}{d\omega}\\) where \\(d\omega = \frac{dA^{\bot}}{r^2}\\) for a sphere.

Integrating over an entire sphere: \\(\Omega = 4\pi r^2\\)

1336 W/m^2

\\(\\)

Radiant Exitance: \\(M = \frac{d\Phi}{dA}\\)

Emitted energy in 5 minutes: \\(P\times 300s\\)

\\(1.68 \times 300 = )

# Part 3

> The light bulb from above is observed by an eye, which has an opening of the pupil of 6 mm and a distance
of 1 m from the light bulb. Find the irradiance received in the eye.

We will make multiple approximations.

# Part 4

> A 200 W spherically shaped light bulb (20% efficiency) emits red light of wavelength 650 nm equally in all
directions. The light bulb is placed 2 m above a table. Calculate the irradiance at the table.
>
> Photometric quantities can be calculated from radiometric ones based on the equation

>\\[Photometric = Radiometric · 685 · V (λ)\\]
>
>in which V (λ) is the luminous efficiency curve. At 650 nm, the luminous efficiency curve has a value of 0.1. Calculate the illuminance.

# Part 5

> In a simple arrangement the luminous intensity of an unknown light source is determined from a known light source. The light sources are placed 1 m from each other and illuminate a double sided screen placed between the light sources. The screen is moved until both sides are equally illuminated as observed by a photometer. At the position of match, the screen is 35 cm from the known source with luminous intensity Is = 40 lm/sr = 40 cd and 65 cm from the unknown light source. What is the luminous intensity Ix of the unknown source?

# Part 6

> The radiance L from a diffuse light source (emitter) of 10×10 cm is 5000 W/(sr m2). Calculate the radiosity (radiant exitance). How much energy is emitted from the light source?

# Part 7

> The radiance L = 6000 cos θ W/(m2
sr) for a non-diffuse emitter of area 10 by 10 cm. Find the radiant exitance. Also, find the power of the entire light source.
